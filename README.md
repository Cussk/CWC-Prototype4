# CWC-Prototype4
 Prototype 4 Basic Gameplay Mechanics
 
Project learning gameplay mechanics with Unity and C#.
 
King of the Hill style game with spheres and powerups.  Added rigidbody and physics to spheres so collisions would create rebounds and frictions.  Scripted main camera rotating around a focal point and using that for player directional movement.  Applied force to player sphere for forward and backward movement.  Enemies scripted to follow the player using the difference in vectors of player and enemy.  Added powerup pickups to allow player to bounce enemy spheres off arena for set time.  Set up enemy prefabs and created a spawn manager to spawn enemies in random positions in arena.  Used For-loops to script game waves increasing the number of enemies each wave.  All scripted in C#.
 
Added bonus features consisting of creating an array of enemy prefabs to allow spawn manager to spawn random types of enemies each wave.  Created 2 new powerups with different effects.  First homing rockets, which target and pursue the enemy pushing them off the arena and destroying themselves.  Second smashing attack, player jumps in the air and smashes the ground causing and AOE explosion pushing the spheres away from player.  Added a Boss sphere and spawned it on specific waves, boss is able to spawn minions over time until it is defeated.  All scripted with C#. 
 
 Challenge code solved fixing issues to make scene playable.
